# Checklist App

For the second project in the course, we were paired up to create a simple application utilizing Mongoose. Our application is a travel checklist app designed to create the "ultimate packing list" for travelers to ensure they pack everything they need to make their trip as enjoyable as possible.

## Technologies Used

In this project, we used HTML, CSS, Javascript, MongoDB, and Express JS. 

## Icebox Features
